# Java-Programs
Some programs written in java.

1. Climbing_Stairs-> You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
2. doubleStack-> Implement two stacks in a single array.
3. findKthLargest-> Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
4. fidMin-> Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
5. hashSet-> Implementation of hash set in java.
6. ipaddress-> Find ipaddress of different websites.
7. Iterator-> Implementing iterator in java.
8. jdbcTest-> Connecting mysql database to java.
9. largest_subarray-> Find the sum of the contiguous subarray within a array with the largest sum.
10. longestCommonSub-> Given two strings, the task is to find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of the strings.
11. maps-> Implementing hashmap and treemap.
12. matrix_multiplication-> Matrix Multiplication using multi threading.
13. matrixChainMultiplication-> Find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together such that the total number of element multiplications is minimum.
15. multithreading_array_search-> Searching an element in the array using multithreading.
16. productExceptSelf-> Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
17. queue-> Implementing queue in java.
18. rodCutting-> Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that includes prices of all pieces of size smaller than n. Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.
19. Rotate_Image -> You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
20. socketClass -> Implementing socket class.
21. stackTest -> Implementing stack in java.
22. threeSum-> Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]==0.
23. treeSet -> Implementing tree set in java.
24. tripleStack -> Implementing 3 stacks in one array. 
25. Valid_Anagram -> Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
